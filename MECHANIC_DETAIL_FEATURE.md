     3. Cleans up all references
   - **Redirect**: Returns to Mechanic Management after successful dismissal

## Technical Implementation

### API Functions Added to `api.js`

```javascript
mechanicsAPI.updateMechanic(mechanicId, updates)
// Updates mechanic fields (e.g., hourly_rate)

mechanicsAPI.deleteMechanic(mechanicId)
// Deletes mechanic and removes all references from service_requests
```

### Files Created/Modified

1. **NEW**: `client/src/pages/MechanicDetail.js`
   - Complete mechanic detail view component
   - Hourly rate editing functionality
   - Bonus calculation and display
   - Dismiss mechanic with confirmation

2. **MODIFIED**: `client/src/config/api.js`
   - Added `updateMechanic()` function
   - Added `deleteMechanic()` function with cascade logic

3. **MODIFIED**: `client/src/pages/MechanicManagement.js`
   - Made table rows clickable
   - Added navigation to detail page

4. **MODIFIED**: `client/src/App.js`
   - Added route: `/mechanic-detail/:mechanicId`
   - Updated ConditionalNavbar to hide on detail page

## Usage Flow

### For Managers:

1. **Navigate**: Manager Dashboard → Mechanic Management
2. **Select**: Click on any mechanic row in the table
3. **View Details**: See complete profile, stats, and completed jobs
4. **Edit Rate**: 
   - Click "Edit" next to Hourly Rate
   - Enter new rate
   - Click "Save"
5. **View Earnings**:
   - See total bonus in right column
   - Scroll through completed jobs to see individual bonuses
6. **Dismiss (Optional)**:
   - Click "Dismiss Mechanic" button
   - Confirm in modal
   - Manager returns to management page

## Bonus Calculation Example

```javascript
Mechanic completes 3 jobs:
Job 1: ₹10,000 → Bonus: ₹300 (3%)
Job 2: ₹5,000  → Bonus: ₹150 (3%)
Job 3: ₹8,000  → Bonus: ₹240 (3%)

Total Bonus Earned: ₹690
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Cascade Deletion**: Service requests are preserved but mechanic reference is removed
2. **Confirmation Modal**: Prevents accidental dismissals
3. **Validation**: Hourly rate must be positive number
4. **Error Handling**: Shows error messages for failed operations
